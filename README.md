# MSPTech Code of Conduct

The MSPTech Slack Community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all channels. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the admins.

If you are being harassed by a member of the community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please direct message one of the moderators, who will respond as promptly as they can:

* Kevin Marx (kevin)
* Chris Arcand (chris)

The MSPTech Slack instance is first and foremost a place to connect and chat with other members of the local tech community and _not_ a recruiting tool. Please refrain from posting available positions at your company anywhere but the #jobs channel.
